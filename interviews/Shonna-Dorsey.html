    <h3 class = "gwc-general2"> <span> Q: </span> What is a regular work day like for you? </h3>
    <h3 class = "gwc-general3"> <span> A: </span>It depends. I do spend a lot of time in meetings.</h3>

<div class="gwc-qanda">
    <h3 class = "gwc-general2"> <span> Q: </span> When did you become inspired to partake in tech? What was your inspiration?  </h3>
    <h3 class = "gwc-general3"> <span> A: </span>High school. I went to Omaha North High School and we were surorunded by technology. It was a natural fit for me. Even I was considering a medical career, I always found my way back to tech (built and managed a website for a student group, created an automated prescription price calculator based on various user inputs in Excel, built a small program for a DNA homework assignment in Excel as a bonus project during a Bioinformatics course, etc.).</h3>

<div class="gwc-qanda">

    <h3 class = "gwc-general3"> <span> A: </span>Life and work experiences have prepared me for today. I am still learning every day, but my desire to empower people gets me through the tough moments.</h3>

<div class="gwc-qanda">
    <h3 class = "gwc-general2"> <span> Q: </span> What is the biggest obstacle you've been faced with, and how are/did you overcoming/overcome it?</h3>
    <h3 class = "gwc-general3"> <span> A: </span>One of the biggest obstacles for me is that it is tough to be the only African American woman in tech in the room in many cases. I have to work on overcoming that current reality and focus on what I am here to do - empower others through my skills, abilities and network.</h3>

<div class="gwc-qanda">
    <h3 class = "gwc-general2"> <span> Q: </span> What non-tech skill do you find most helpful/important that's for your career?</h3>
    <h3 class = "gwc-general3"> <span> A: </span>People skills. I am also patient, flexible and try not to take myself too seriously. 
</h3>
</div>
    
<div class="gwc-qanda">
    <h3 class = "gwc-general2"> <span> Q: </span> Where do you see yourself in ten years?</h3>
    <h3 class = "gwc-general3"> <span> A: </span>Not sure yet. I did not see myself here 5 years ago. I only hope that whatever I am doing makes it easier for me to empower others in more ways that are bigger and better than what I am doing today.</h3>
</div>
 
<div class="gwc-qanda">
