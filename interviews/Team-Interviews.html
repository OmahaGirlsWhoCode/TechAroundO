            I'm an only child of South Asian heritage, and I currently enjoy writing, playing trombone, learning photography, and eating licorice. In ten years, I imagine I'd be pursuing a masters in a STEM subject, and possibly working on the side with a start-up. Whatever I do, I know I'll be happy, because I'll be striving towards my dreams.

           I am fairly new to coding and I enjoy running, weightlifting, sports, food and music. In ten years I could probably see myself studying subjects that interest me -- I'm not really afraid of staying in school. Hopefully in ten years I'll be training/have competed in a few races and weightlifting competitions. Along with that, I could see myself writing and creating some art on the side.

          I am interested in music, and how you can mix technology and music. I played bass and piano, and music is a big part of my life. I also really love dogs.  
In ten years, I see myself trying to get a PhD and being in an internship, furthering my skills in my field. </div>

            I was born in Japan, and can speak both languages fluently. I am in dance and take five classes a week. I am a proud nerd and fangirl. I love to watch old show reruns, most BBC TV shows, and lots of anime. I also am into a wide range of music excluding only pop and country. In ten years, I see myself in Stanford taking courses in engineering, bio-tech, Japanese, computer science, chemistry, and math.</div>
