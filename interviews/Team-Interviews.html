           I am an only child born in Nebraska. My hobbies include but definitely aren't limited to playing piano and trombone, learning photography with my dad, and eating licorice. In ten years I imagine my self studying Computer Science and/or economics and eventually going into a career that has to do with cyber security or financial engineering.

           I am fairly new to coding and I enjoy running, weightlifting, sports, food and music. In ten years I could probably see myself studying subjects that interest me -- I'm not really afraid of staying in school. Hopefully in ten years I'll be training/have competed in a few races and weightlifting competitions. Along with that, I could see myself writing and creating some art on the side.

            I was born in Japan, and can speak both languages fluently. I am in dance and take five classes a week. I am a proud nerd and fangirl. I love to watch old show reruns, most BBC TV shows, and lots of anime. I also am into a wide range of music excluding only pop and country. In ten years, I see myself in Stanford taking courses in engineering, bio-tech, Japanese, computer science, chemistry, and math.</div>

            I learned about coding around two years ago, and since then it has pretty much overtaken my life. I try to get as involved as possible in my school and community. I believe it is important to be passionate about everything that I do. In ten years, I would love to start out doing programming and software development, then eventually work my way up to becoming a Project Manager.
